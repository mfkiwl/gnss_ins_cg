# SINS

Strapdown Inertial Navigation System

Some basic processes for SINS based on **MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity)** are implemented, including electromagnetic compass calibration, an **AHRS (attitude and heading reference system)** that use an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and trace tracking. Loosely coupling sensor fusion by using the minimum squared error (MSE) method is also implemented.

# AHRS

Attitude and Heading Reference System

An AHRS consists of sensors on three axes that provide attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. These are sometimes referred to as **MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity)** sensors and consist of either solid-state or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) **gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers**.

The key difference between an IMU and an AHRS is the addition of an on-board processing system in an AHRS, which provides attitude and heading information.

# Dead Reckoning

In navigation, dead reckoning is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course.
