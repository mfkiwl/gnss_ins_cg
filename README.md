# GNSS in inertial navigation

Inertial navigation systems can take advantage of additional constellation to use more satellites and further improve signal robustness in harsh environments such as urban canyons, forests, mountains.

* [Aceinna/gnss-ins-sim](https://github.com/Aceinna/gnss-ins-sim): GNSS-INS-SIM is an GNSS/INS simulation project, which generates reference trajectories, IMU sensor output, GPS output, odometer output and magnetometer output.

# Geomagnetics
